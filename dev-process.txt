Hello!
Here's the development process:
1- I spent some time looking at the wireframe trying to figure out ways to improve it.
2- I found room for improvement like font, information layout, adding somme buttons (phone), horizontal swipe of gallery, responsive design etc.I only implemented responsiveness.
3- I weighed in options to write CSS and settled on pure CSS. Since it's a one-page project.
4- I used CSS grid and flexbox. In production, one should use autoprefixer with a build tool.
5- At the start, I was planning to use Vanilla Js, but since I'm learning Vue Js, I want to give it a try.

Aside from vue.js CLI (that which comes with laravel --I didn't use) nothing was difficult. At least not that I didn't figure out how to do.

1- I used Vue cdn.
2- I used git
Nothing fancy, this project is too small
